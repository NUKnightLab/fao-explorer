fao-explorer
============

Example components from a potentially larger tool that supports exploring data over time on a country-by-country basis. This data focuses on China, India, Nigeria and Brazil. Current components include population data from the UN against LANDSAT imagery from Google Earth Engine and livestock production vs. investment in various types of agriculture.

## Data components

The `data` folder contains raw data and various scripts for transformaton. Not all of this data will be used in the application, but we explored many different statistics for possible correlation. The data transformation uses the `pandas` library. 

## App components

The `app` folder contains the frontend of the application. TKTKTK
